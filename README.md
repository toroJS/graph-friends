## About this ionic demo
This repo is the code of an Ionic 5 starter app that we created as part of the post: **[Ionic Firebase Authentication Tutorial](https://ionicthemes.com/tutorials/about/firebase-authentication-in-ionic-framework-apps). In this post we explain how to perform Social Sign In with Firebase from an Ionic application.**

Most apps need to know the identity of the user who is using it. Knowing a user's identity allows an app to securely save user data in the cloud and provide a personalized experience across all of the user's devices.

In this Ionic + Firebase tutorial you will learn how to create an Ionic Framework Application with Firebase Authentication. We will show you how to configure both the Firebase and the Ionic 5 App to enable authentication with social providers such as Google, Facebook and Twitter and also with Email and Password.

As an example we built this Ionic Framework application that allows users to log in and log out using all of the above mentioned authentication options. Once they log in, they will see a profile page with their basic profile info taken from the authentication provider.
